									<h3><span>How we Operate</span></h3>
								</div>								
								<p>. For the qualified applicant, we pay the flight ticket from the country of residence to the destination of work.</p>
                                <p>. Upon arrival, we immediately connect the qualified applicant with the employer and start working immediately.</p>
                                <p>. When one meets our qualifications, we immediately link them to an agent from their country who will help to ensure the successful applicant travels safely and has a safe and comfortable stay at their place of work.</p>

								<p>. The successful applicant is required to communicate with the agent in order to pay accommodation fee for at least 2 months as required by the Housing Act for Internationals.</p>
                                 <p>. If the successful applicant has no Visa Card, then should also consult the agent to ensure it is processed in time to avoid delays.</p>
